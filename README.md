#### A simple userscript to enhance the school platform moodle.
#### What it does:

* Logs you in automatically
* Saves your preferences
#### How to use:
You may use Tampermonkey to create a new script and paste in the contents of [`userscript.js`](https://github.com/A-INDUSTRIES/BetterMoodle/blob/main/userscript.js).
##### If you encounter any bug, put it in [Issues](https://github.com/A-INDUSTRIES/BetterMoodle/issues)!
##### I'll be more than happy to look into it!
